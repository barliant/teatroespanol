# teatroespanol: Spanish Golden Age Drama Analysis

This repository contains experimental, derivative data from some initial analyses into the network structure of Spanish Golden Age drama.

* "myzf" = Data abstracted from the full plays as data about each speech, in the form of a csv file
* "matrices" = Further abstraction as an adjacency matrix (speaker x speaker) as a csv file
* "graphs" = Same information as in the matrices, but in the gexf (XML) format suitable for networkx
* "plots" = visual representation of the data in "graphs", with a threshold of 100 words for a valid interaction

Python scripts used:
